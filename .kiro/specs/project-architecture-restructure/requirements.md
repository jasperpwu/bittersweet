5. WHEN organizing components THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for all components specified in the architecture overview

### Requirement 4: Service File Structure Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete service file structure, so that I have organized placeholders for external integrations and business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating service structure THEN the system SHALL create service directories for api, storage, notifications, screentime, and analytics
2. WHEN organizing API services THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for client.ts, auth.ts, focus.ts, rewards.ts, and social.ts
3. WHEN setting up storage services THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for secure.ts, cache.ts, and offline.ts
4. WHEN creating notification services THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for manager.ts, scheduler.ts, and handlers.ts
5. WHEN organizing screentime services THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for ios.ts, android.ts, and manager.ts

### Requirement 5: Custom Hooks File Structure Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized placeholder files for custom hooks, so that I have a clear structure for implementing business logic hooks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating hooks structure THEN the system SHALL create hook directories organized by feature domain (auth, focus, rewards, journal, social, common)
2. WHEN organizing hook files THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for authentication hooks (useAuth.ts, useAuthGuard.ts)
3. WHEN setting up focus hooks THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for focus session hooks (useFocusSession.ts, useTimer.ts, useSessionHistory.ts)
4. WHEN creating reward hooks THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for reward system hooks (useRewards.ts, useSeedBalance.ts)
5. WHEN organizing common hooks THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for shared hooks (useScreenTime.ts, useNotifications.ts, useOfflineSync.ts)

### Requirement 6: Type Definition File Structure Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized TypeScript type definition files, so that I have a clear structure for implementing type safety across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating type structure THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for api.ts, models.ts, navigation.ts, and store.ts
2. WHEN organizing type files THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated types directory containing all type definition files
3. WHEN setting up type files THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files that will contain interfaces for data entities
4. WHEN creating navigation types THEN the system SHALL create placeholder file for Expo Router type definitions
5. WHEN organizing store types THEN the system SHALL create placeholder file for Zustand store interfaces

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Utilities File Structure Creation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized configuration and utility files, so that I have a clear structure for managing app settings and common functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating config structure THEN the system SHALL create config directory with placeholder files for theme.ts, env.ts, and constants.ts
2. WHEN organizing utility files THEN the system SHALL create utils directory with placeholder files for time.ts, validation.ts, formatting.ts, permissions.ts, and constants.ts
3. WHEN setting up configuration files THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files that will contain theme configuration and environment variables
4. WHEN creating utility structure THEN the system SHALL organize utility files by functionality type
5. WHEN organizing constants THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files for centralized app-wide constants

### Requirement 8: App Directory Structure Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an enhanced app directory structure that supports the full feature set, so that I have proper navigation organization for all app screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhancing app structure THEN the system SHALL create additional tab files (focus.tsx, journal.tsx, insights.tsx, tasks.tsx, squads.tsx) in the (tabs) directory
2. WHEN organizing navigation THEN the system SHALL create (auth) directory with placeholder files for authentication flow
3. WHEN setting up modals THEN the system SHALL create (modals) directory with placeholder files for modal screens
4. WHEN creating app structure THEN the system SHALL maintain existing _layout.tsx and index.tsx files
5. WHEN organizing screens THEN the system SHALL ensure proper file naming conventions following Expo Router patterns

### Requirement 9: Existing File Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve existing functionality while creating the new structure, so that the current app continues to work during the restructuring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new structure THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing files in their current locations
2. WHEN adding new directories THEN the system SHALL not modify existing component files or app screens
3. WHEN creating placeholder files THEN the system SHALL not interfere with existing Zustand store functionality
4. WHEN organizing new structure THEN the system SHALL maintain existing import paths and navigation
5. WHEN establishing new architecture THEN the system SHALL ensure existing app functionality remains intact

### Requirement 10: Complete File Structure Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete file structure foundation that matches the architecture overview, so that I have all necessary placeholder files for future implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the complete structure THEN the system SHALL create all directories and files specified in the architecture overview
2. WHEN organizing the foundation THEN the system SHALL ensure proper file naming conventions throughout the structure
3. WHEN establishing the structure THEN the system SHALL create index.ts files where appropriate for clean imports
4. WHEN setting up the foundation THEN the system SHALL create placeholder files with basic TypeScript exports to prevent import errors
5. WHEN completing the structure THEN the system SHALL ensure the file organization supports the feature-based architecture principles

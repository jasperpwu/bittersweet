# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create complete directory and file structure
  - Create main `src` directory with all subdirectories: components, services, store, hooks, types, utils, config
  - Create all component directories (ui, focus, rewards, journal, analytics, social) with subdirectories and placeholder files
  - Create all service directories (api, storage, notifications, screentime, analytics) with placeholder files
  - Create store structure with slices and middleware directories and placeholder files
  - Create hooks directories (auth, focus, rewards, journal, social, common) with placeholder files
  - Create types, utils, and config directories with placeholder files
  - Create enhanced app directory structure with new tab files and (auth)/(modals) directories
  - Create all index.ts files for clean imports throughout the structure
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.5, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.5_

- [x] 2. Add TypeScript placeholder content to all files
  - Add basic React component structure to all component placeholder files with proper TypeScript interfaces
  - Add service object structure to all service placeholder files with proper exports
  - Add custom hook structure to all hook placeholder files with proper return types
  - Add Zustand store structure to all store placeholder files with proper interfaces
  - Add TypeScript type definitions to all type files
  - Add utility function placeholders to all utility files
  - Add configuration object placeholders to all config files
  - Add basic screen structure to all new app directory files
  - _Requirements: 10.4, 10.5_

- [x] 3. Validate and test the complete file structure
  - Verify all directories and files have been created correctly according to architecture specification
  - Test TypeScript compilation to ensure no syntax errors in placeholder files
  - Check that all index.ts files export correctly and enable clean imports
  - Verify existing app functionality remains intact (screens, navigation, components, store)
  - Confirm development server starts without errors and build process works correctly
  - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.4, 9.5, 10.1, 10.2, 10.4, 10.5_

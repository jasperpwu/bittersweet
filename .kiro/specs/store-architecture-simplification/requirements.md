# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current store architecture in the bittersweet mobile app is over-engineered with enterprise-level complexity that creates more problems than it solves. This feature will simplify the Zustand store architecture to match the actual requirements of a mobile focus app, eliminating circular dependencies, type inconsistencies, and unnecessary abstraction layers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple and maintainable store architecture, so that I can easily understand, modify, and debug the application state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the store is initialized THEN it SHALL load without circular dependency errors
2. WHEN the app starts THEN the store SHALL be fully functional without undefined methods
3. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN there SHALL be zero type errors in store-related files
4. WHEN a developer examines the store code THEN they SHALL understand the architecture within 15 minutes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my focus session data to persist reliably, so that my progress is never lost between app sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a focus session THEN the session data SHALL be saved to local storage
2. WHEN I restart the app THEN my previous session history SHALL be available
3. WHEN the app crashes during a session THEN I SHALL be able to resume or recover the session
4. WHEN persistence fails THEN the app SHALL continue to function with in-memory state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want focus session timers to work accurately, so that I can trust the app to track my time correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a focus session THEN the timer SHALL count down accurately
2. WHEN I pause a session THEN the timer SHALL stop and preserve remaining time
3. WHEN I resume a session THEN the timer SHALL continue from where it left off
4. WHEN the app goes to background THEN the timer SHALL continue running accurately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of concerns in the store, so that each slice manages only its own domain logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the focus slice THEN it SHALL only contain focus session logic
2. WHEN examining the tasks slice THEN it SHALL only contain task management logic
3. WHEN examining the UI slice THEN it SHALL only contain UI state logic
4. WHEN slices need to communicate THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal and focused error handling, so that errors are caught appropriately without over-engineering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a store operation fails THEN the error SHALL be logged clearly
2. WHEN persistence fails THEN the app SHALL fall back to in-memory state gracefully
3. WHEN an invalid action is dispatched THEN it SHALL be handled without crashing
4. WHEN debugging errors THEN the error messages SHALL be clear and actionable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the store to follow React Native best practices, so that it integrates well with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the store in components THEN it SHALL follow standard Zustand patterns
2. WHEN the store updates THEN React components SHALL re-render appropriately
3. WHEN using TypeScript THEN all store operations SHALL be fully typed
4. WHEN testing components THEN the store SHALL be easily mockable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to start quickly, so that I can begin focus sessions without delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the store SHALL initialize in under 500ms
2. WHEN the store loads persisted data THEN it SHALL not block the UI thread
3. WHEN the app is ready THEN all store functionality SHALL be immediately available
4. WHEN using the app THEN store operations SHALL feel instantaneous

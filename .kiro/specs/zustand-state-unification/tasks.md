# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up unified store foundation with types and middleware
  - Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and base entity types in `src/store/types.ts`
  - Implement core middleware (persistence, devtools, error handling, performance monitoring)
  - Set up entity manager utility and store event bus for cross-store communication
  - Configure root store with middleware integration in `src/store/index.ts`
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 9.1_

- [x] 2. Implement core domain slices (auth, focus, tasks)
  - Create auth slice with user management, authentication tokens, and session handling
  - Migrate and enhance focus slice with normalized structure and cross-store integration
  - Enhance tasks slice with focus session linking and improved relationship management
  - Implement async state patterns and error handling for all core slices
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 8.2, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4_

- [x] 3. Implement feature domain slices (rewards, social, settings, UI)
  - Create rewards slice with transaction management and app unlock functionality
  - Implement social slice with squad and challenge management
  - Create settings slice with comprehensive user preferences and persistence
  - Add UI slice for application state, modals, and loading indicators
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2, 7.4, 8.2, 9.1_

- [x] 4. Create advanced selectors, hooks, and performance optimizations
  - Implement memoized selectors and computed state for all domains
  - Create typed hooks with selective subscriptions and performance optimization
  - Add performance monitoring, lazy loading, and memory management
  - Implement state cleanup mechanisms and optimization patterns
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.4, 4.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 7.5_

- [x] 5. Implement testing infrastructure and migration utilities
  - Create comprehensive testing utilities with mock factories and test helpers
  - Implement unit and integration tests for all store slices and cross-store communication
  - Create migration utilities for existing store data with validation and rollback
  - Add performance testing and migration validation
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5_

- [x] 6. Finalize integration and cleanup legacy implementations
  - Optimize state persistence and hydration with versioning support
  - Update all component integrations to use unified store
  - Remove legacy store implementations and validate complete functionality
  - Create documentation and migration guide for development team
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 7.1, 7.4, 8.1, 8.4, 8.5, 9.5, 10.4, 10.5_

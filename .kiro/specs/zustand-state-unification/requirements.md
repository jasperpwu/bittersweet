# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for unifying and optimizing the Zustand state management architecture across the bittersweet React Native application. The current implementation has fragmented stores, inconsistent patterns, and lacks proper TypeScript integration, middleware standardization, and cross-store dependencies management. This specification aims to create a unified, type-safe, and performant state management solution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: State Architecture Audit and Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audit of the current state management patterns, so that I can understand the fragmentation issues and plan the unification strategy effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing current stores THEN the system SHALL identify all existing Zustand store implementations and their usage patterns
2. WHEN examining state fragmentation THEN the system SHALL document redundant state across different stores (e.g., user data in both homeSlice)
3. WHEN reviewing cross-dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify stores that depend on data from other stores
4. WHEN assessing TypeScript integration THEN the system SHALL evaluate type safety gaps and inconsistent typing patterns
5. WHEN analyzing persistence patterns THEN the system SHALL document inconsistent AsyncStorage usage and middleware implementation

### Requirement 2: Unified Store Architecture Design

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified store architecture with domain separation and standardized patterns, so that I can maintain consistent state management across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the unified architecture THEN the system SHALL create a single root store with domain-separated slices
2. WHEN establishing store structure THEN the system SHALL implement standardized action patterns with consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN creating store interfaces THEN the system SHALL define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all state domains
4. WHEN designing middleware integration THEN the system SHALL standardize persistence, devtools, and logging middleware across all slices
5. WHEN organizing store domains THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into focus, tasks, rewards, settings, and UI domains

### Requirement 3: Type Safety and Interface Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and type safety throughout the state management layer, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better developer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining state interfaces THEN the system SHALL create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all state domains
2. WHEN implementing actions THEN the system SHALL define strongly-typed action interfaces with proper parameter typing
3. WHEN creating selectors THEN the system SHALL implement type-safe selector functions with proper return type inference

5. WHEN integrating with React components THEN the system SHALL provide typed hooks that ensure type safety at the component level

### Requirement 4: State Normalization and Data Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want normalized state structure and efficient data management patterns, so that I can avoid data duplication and ensure consistent data access across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN normalizing state THEN the system SHALL implement normalized data structures for entities like users, tasks, sessions
2. WHEN managing relationships THEN the system SHALL create efficient lookup patterns for related data entities
3. WHEN handling data updates THEN the system SHALL implement immutable update patterns that maintain referential integrity
4. WHEN caching data THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies that prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. WHEN managing derived state THEN the system SHALL create computed selectors that efficiently derive state from normalized data

### Requirement 5: Async State and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized async state management and error handling patterns, so that I can handle loading states, errors, and data fetching consistently across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL implement standardized loading, success, and error states for all async actions
2. WHEN managing API calls THEN the system SHALL create consistent patterns for handling network requests and responses
3. WHEN implementing error boundaries THEN the system SHALL provide error recovery mechanisms and user-friendly error states
4. WHEN handling offline scenarios THEN the system SHALL implement offline-first patterns with proper sync mechanisms
5. WHEN managing optimistic updates THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms for failed operations

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized state management that minimizes re-renders and provides excellent performance, so that the application remains responsive and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing selectors THEN the system SHALL create memoized selectors that prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN managing subscriptions THEN the system SHALL implement fine-grained subscriptions that only update relevant components
3. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and virtualization support in state management
4. WHEN persisting state THEN the system SHALL optimize persistence operations to avoid blocking the main thread
5. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup mechanisms for unused state and prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 7: Middleware Integration and DevTools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive middleware integration and development tools, so that I can debug state changes, persist data reliably, and monitor application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating persistence THEN the system SHALL implement standardized AsyncStorage middleware with selective persistence
2. WHEN enabling devtools THEN the system SHALL integrate Redux DevTools for state inspection and time-travel debugging
3. WHEN implementing logging THEN the system SHALL create development logging middleware that tracks state changes and actions
4. WHEN handling state hydration THEN the system SHALL implement reliable state rehydration with migration support
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide performance monitoring middleware for state operations

### Requirement 8: Migration Strategy and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a safe migration strategy that preserves existing functionality, so that I can transition to the unified state management without breaking the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning migration THEN the system SHALL create a phased migration approach that maintains backward compatibility
2. WHEN migrating existing stores THEN the system SHALL preserve existing state data and user preferences
3. WHEN updating components THEN the system SHALL provide migration guides and automated refactoring tools where possible
4. WHEN testing migration THEN the system SHALL ensure all existing functionality continues to work during and after migration
5. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL remove deprecated store implementations and clean up unused code

### Requirement 9: Cross-Store Communication and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient cross-store communication patterns, so that I can manage dependencies between different state domains without creating tight coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing cross-store dependencies THEN the system SHALL create event-based communication patterns between stores
2. WHEN managing shared state THEN the system SHALL identify and consolidate shared state into appropriate domain stores
3. WHEN handling cascading updates THEN the system SHALL implement efficient update propagation that maintains data consistency
4. WHEN creating store subscriptions THEN the system SHALL provide subscription mechanisms that allow stores to react to changes in other stores
5. WHEN managing store initialization THEN the system SHALL ensure proper initialization order and dependency resolution

### Requirement 10: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing patterns for the unified state management, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.
